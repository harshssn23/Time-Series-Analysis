# Time-Series-Analysis
 The Time Series Analysis using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Serimax model is a comprehensive approach for forecasting and analyzing time-dependent data. This methodology combines the power of ARIMA, a widely-used statistical model, with the flexibility and versatility of the Serimax model for improved accuracy.
 
 ARIMA is particularly effective in capturing the autocorrelation and seasonality patterns present in time series data. It integrates autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components, along with differencing to stabilize non-stationary time series. This foundation is enhanced by incorporating the Serimax model, which is adept at handling complex, non-linear relationships in time-dependent data.

The combined ARIMA-Serimax model excels in capturing intricate temporal dependencies, making it suitable for various applications such as financial forecasting, demand prediction, and environmental monitoring. The application of this model involves time series data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The Serimax component contributes by accommodating non-linear trends and improving the overall predictive accuracy.

This analytical approach empowers users to gain insights into historical patterns, make informed predictions, and optimize decision-making based on the temporal dynamics of the dataset. The integration of ARIMA and Serimax models provides a robust framework for time series analysis, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the underlying patterns and trends in the data.
